=======

A small maze generator in JS. 

#About:

A small maze generator written in Javascript with a recursive algorithm (depth-first search, I think) that usually generates a large correct path with a few smaller dead-ends.

#Rationale:

I just wanted to test class syntax, imports and exports without a transpiler. In any case, there are two code branches present: one for EC6 (imports, exports) and one for declaring everything in a single file.

#TODO

	- Display with a canvas.
	- Add the ability to "play" the maze.
